I’m _Justin Malčić_, a trainee software engineer embarking on a master’s in CS at Imperial in October 2022 to finish in 2023. I’ve long been a Rubyist and have significant experience with Rails, but I also work with many other languages and frameworks: lately I’ve been using Rust to implement an extension to Git, and Swift for building a macOS app. I enjoy writing software which is useful and ergonomic for humans, and which provides proper solutions to complex and interesting problems, whether in the real or virtual world.

I recently completed a linguistics master’s in early 2022, where I was especially interested in the formal side of syntax, phonology, and their interface. My masters was at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I was advised by Juan Uriagereka and Bill Idsardi. Before that, my undergrad was at the University of Cambridge, where my Director of Studies and dissertation supervisor was Theresa Biberauer.
