I’m _Justin Malčić_, a graduate software engineer having recently completed a master’s in CS at Imperial. I’ve been a Rubyist for 10 years and have significant experience with Rails, but also work with many other languages and frameworks—lately I’ve been working in Rust to implement an experimental VCS to track the structure of source code using LSPs.

What motivates me to write software is the ability to provide useful and ergonomic solutions to complex and interesting problems, whether in the real or virtual world.

Before the master’s I was a linguist, focusing primarily on formal syntax and phonology.
