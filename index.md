I’m _Justin Malčić_, a trainee software engineer, currently applying for Computer Science masters courses for entry autumn 2022. I’ve long been a Rubyist and have significant experience with Rails, but I also work with many other languages and frameworks: lately I’ve been using Rust to implement an extension to Git, and Swift for building a macOS app. I enjoy writing software which is useful and ergonomic for humans, and which provides proper solutions to complex and interesting problems, whether in the real or virtual world.

I’m currently in the middle of completing a linguistics master’s, intending to finish in late 2021. Within linguistics, I’ve been especially interested in the formal side of syntax, phonology, and their interface. My masters has been at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I’ve been advised by Juan Uriagereka and Bill Idsardi. Before that, my undergrad was at the University of Cambridge, where my Director of Studies and dissertation supervisor was Theresa Biberauer.
