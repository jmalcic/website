I’m _Justin Malčić_, a trainee software engineer, currently applying for Computer Science masters courses for entry autumn 2022. I’ve long been a Rubyist and have significant experience with Rails, but I also work with many other languages and frameworks: lately I’ve been using Rust to implement an extension to Git, and Swift for building a macOS app. I enjoy writing software which is useful and ergonomic for humans, and which provides proper solutions to complex and interesting problems, whether in the real or virtual world.

I’ve just completed a linguistics master’s, where I was especially interested in the formal side of syntax, phonology, and their interface. My masters was at the University of Maryland, College Park, where I was advised by Juan Uriagereka and Bill Idsardi. Before that, my undergrad was at the University of Cambridge, where my Director of Studies and dissertation supervisor was Theresa Biberauer.
